[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) are tests that run each time you
attempt to commit. If the tests pass, the commit will be made, otherwise not. A
very basic test is to check if the code is parsable, making sure you have not
forgotten a comma, brace or quote.

The goal of this package is to twofold:

- Provide a set of hooks that are useful when your git repo contains R code. You
  can find them under `vignette("available-hooks")`.

- Provide [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)-like functionality for
  common tasks such as installation and set-up and config file modification.

## Installation

Please make sure you have conda installed. The rest can be handled from R:

```{r}
# once on your system
remotes::install_github("lorenzwalthert/precommit")
precommit::install_precommit()

# once in every git repo either
# * after cloning a repo that already uses pre-commit or
# * if you want introduce pre-commit to this repo
precommit::use_precommit()
```

This installs pre-commit and performs some other set-up tasks. If you don't want
to use conda, see `vignette("manual-installation")` for alternative installation
methods.

## Usage 

The next time you run `git commit`, the hooks listed in your
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` will get executed before the commit. The helper
function `precommit::open_config()` let's you open and edit the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` conveniently from the RStudio console. When any file
is changed due to running a hook or the hook script errors, the commit will
fail. You can inspect the changes introduced by the hook and if satisfied, you
can attempt to commit again. Note that while some hooks change files (like the
styler hook) so that they won't fail when you attempt to commit again, some
(like the lintr hook) will need your action before they pass at the next
attempt. If all hooks pass, the commit is made. You can also [temporarily
disable hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks). If you
succeed, it should look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/screenshot.png")
```

See the hooks provided by this repo under `vignette("available-hooks")`. You can
also add other hooks from other repos, by extending the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, e.g. like this:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/precommit
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks: 
    -   id: check-added-large-files
```

To update the hook revisions, run `precommit::autoupdate()`.

## Caution 

- **Do not abort while hooks are running.** Non-staged changes are stashed to a
  temp directory when the hooks are run and may not easily be recovered
  afterwards.

- Because R is not officially supported as a langauge in the pre-commit
  framework (yet), there is no R package dependency management for the R hooks
  provided in this repo. If an R package that is needed by a hook is not yet
  installed, you might get this error:

```{r}
# > Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called ‘__name_of_package__’
```
  In that case, just install the package with `install.packages()` once and 
  try to commit again.
  All R dependencies of the pre-commit hooks provided in this repo are suggested
  dependencies of this R package, so if you want to install them all, just 
  `remotes::install_github("lorenzwalthert/precommit", dependencies = c("Imports", "Suggests"))`.
  
## Documentation

The [online
documentation](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/index.html) of this
package only covers the functionality added on top of pre-commit by this
package. Everything else is covered in the extensive [online
documentation](https://pre-commit.com) of the pre-commit framework itself,
including how to:

- create pre-push hooks

- create local hooks

- and more

## Uninstallation

```{r}
uninstall_precommit("repo") # just for the repo you are in.
uninstall_precommit("global") # remove the pre-commit conda executable.
```
